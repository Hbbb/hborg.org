          <h2>Habit tracking Telegram bot</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
          A Telegram bot that users can add to a chat room and begin tracking
          habits socially. My friends and I built this to help us keep each
          other accountable and involved in each other's lives, through the lens
          of building habits.

          <h2>Meditation Timer</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
          A simple, elegantly designed meditation timer without the bloat of a
          subscription model. I built this to help me meditate more regularly. I
          was annoyed by the lack of a simple meditation timer that didn't
          require a subscription. Moreso, most of the meditation apps available
          have complex UIs that require too much interaction to start a timer.

          <h2>Better Bike</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
          As a New York City resident and avid Citibike user, I was frustrated
          by the UX of the official Citibike app. I realized most of the time
          when I use the Citibike app, I want to know which stations close to me
          have electric bikes available, and how many there are. I built
          BetterBike to solve exactly that problem.
