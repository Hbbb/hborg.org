        <h2>Freshly</h2>
        <p>
          I wore many hats during my time at Freshly. I started as a full stack
          developer, did a brief engineer-in-residence stint on the iOS team,
          then founded the DevOps team, where I spent the remainder of my time.

      <section>
        <h2>Verve Mobile</h2>
        <p>
          Verve was my first job as a professional software engineer. I started
          as a QA engineer, where I built several automation tools to aid the
          manual QA efforts. Shortly after, I was drafted to the core product
          engineering team doing full-stack development with Rails.
